# Hey, I’m Kelechi Kalu 👋  
Cloud • DevOps • Automation • Infrastructure

I build, deploy, secure, and automate modern infrastructure using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and **Linux**.  
I enjoy making systems reliable, scalable, and production-ready — without the drama.

- Design & deploy cloud infrastructure (AWS)
- Automate deployments using Terraform, GitHub Actions & Bash
- Containerize apps with Docker / Docker Compose
- Manage Linux servers (Ubuntu)
- Work with backend teams to ensure smooth CI/CD pipelines
- Secure and monitor cloud workloads
- Solve critical production issues calmly and fast

- **Docker / Docker Compose** (production containers, secure images, multi-service stacks)
- **Bash scripting** (automation, cloud setup, deployments)
- **PM2** (process management for Node applications)
- **NGINX** (reverse proxy, load balancing, domain configs)

---

### **🐧 Operating Systems**
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**: system setup, permissions, SSH, services, logs, networking  
- Server hardening & troubleshooting

---

### **🗂️ Databases & Storage**
- **MySQL / MariaDB** (local + Docker deployments)  
- **PostgreSQL**  
- **Redis** (caching, sessions)  
- **S3** (static assets, backups)

---

### **💻 Programming & Scripting**
- **Python** (beginner–intermediate)  
- **Node.js / Express.js** (setup, deployment, debugging)

---

### **🔐 Security**
- IAM policies  
- SSH key management  
- Securing cloud workloads  
- Deploying HIPAA-compliant environments
